Description: Decision curves are a useful tool to evaluate the population impact
 of adopting a risk prediction instrument into clinical practice. Given one or more
 instruments (risk models) that predict the probability of a binary outcome, this
 package calculates and plots decision curves, which display estimates of the
 standardized net benefit by the probability threshold used to categorize observations
 as 'high risk.' Curves can be estimated using data from an observational cohort, or
 from case-control studies when an estimate of the population outcome prevalence
 is available. Confidence intervals calculated using the bootstrap can be displayed and
 a wrapper function to calculate cross-validated curves using k-fold cross-validation is
 also provided.
