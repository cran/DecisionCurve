\title{Calculate decision curves}
\usage{
decision_curve(formula, data, family = binomial(link = "logit"),
  fitted.risk = FALSE, thresholds = seq(0, 1, by = 0.01),
  confidence.intervals = 0.95, bootstraps = 500,
  study.design = c("cohort", "case-control"), population.prevalence)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{an object of class 'formula' of the form outcome ~ predictors, giving the prediction model to be fitted using glm. The outcome must be a binary variable that equals '1' for cases and '0' for controls.}

\item{data}{data.frame containing outcome and predictors. Missing data on any of the predictors will cause the entire observation to be removed.}

\item{family}{a description of the error distribution and link function to pass to 'glm' used for model fitting. Defaults to binomial(link = "logit") for logistic regression.}

\item{fitted.risk}{logical (default FALSE) indicating whether the predictor provided are estimated risks from an already established model. If set to TRUE, no model fitting will be done and all estimates will be conditional on the risks provided.  Risks must fall between 0 and 1.}

\item{thresholds}{Numeric vector of high risk thresholds to use when plotting and calculating net benefit values.}

\item{confidence.intervals}{Numeric (default 0.95 for 95\% confidence bands) level of bootstrap confidence intervals to plot. Set as NA or 'none' to remove confidence intervals. See details for more information.}

\item{bootstraps}{Number of bootstrap replicates to use to calculate confidence intervals (default 500).}

\item{study.design}{Either 'cohort' (default) or 'case-control' describing the study design used to obtain data. See details for more information.}

\item{population.prevalence}{Outcome prevalence rate in the population used to calculate decision curves when study.design = 'case-control'.}

\value{
List with components
\itemize{
  \item derived.data: A data frame in long form showing the following for each predictor and each 'threshold', 'FPR':false positive rate, 'TPR': true positive rate, 'NB': net benefit, 'sNB': standardized net benefit, 'rho': outcome prevalence, 'prob.high.risk': percent of the population considered high risk. DP': detection probability = TPR*rho, 'model': name of prediction model or 'all' or 'none', cost.benefit.ratio, and 'xx_lower', 'xx_upper': the lower and upper confidence bands for all measures (if calculated).
  \item confidence.intervals: Level of confidence intervals returned.
  \item call: matched function call.

\description{
Decision curves are a useful tool to evaluate the population impact of adopting a risk prediction instrument into clinical practice. Given one or more instruments (risk models) that predict the probability of a binary outcome, this package calculates and plots decision curves, which display estimates of the standardized net benefit by the probabilty threshold used to categorize observations as 'high risk.'  Bootstrap confidence intervals are displayed as well. This package is a companion to the manuscript '(put ref here.)'.
}
\details{
Confidence intervals for (standardized) net benefit are calculated pointwise at each risk threshold. For when data come from an observational cohort, bootstrap sampling is done without stratifying on outcome, so disease prevalence varies within bootstrap samples. For case-control data, bootstrap sampling is done stratified on outcome.
