DecisionCurve 1.4
========================
* Version 1.4 of the package provides an alternative framing of the decision problem for situations where treatment is the standard-of-care and a risk model might be used in order for low-risk patients (i.e., patients below some risk threshold) to opt out of treatment. This is implemented in the package with the addition of the 'policy' argument to function decision_curve.


DecisionCurve 1.3
========================
 * fixed bug in the inputs for createFolds for cv_decision_curve.

* allowed for multiple curves to be plotted together when one curve has CI’s and the other doesn’t
